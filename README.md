**Sentiment Analysis Project – Codveda Internship**

 **Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of my Data Analysis Internship at Codveda Technologies (Aug–Sep 2025).
The dataset contained 732 social media posts across multiple platforms (Twitter, Instagram, etc.) with attributes like text, sentiment, user, country, likes, and retweets.

The goal was to:

- Clean and preprocess the dataset

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize patterns in sentiment distribution, engagement (likes & retweets), and posting activity

- Derive actionable insights

**Tools & Libraries Used**

- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Jupyter Notebook for analysis & documentation

- GitHub for portfolio showcase

**Dataset Details**

Rows: 732

Columns: 15

Key Features:

Text – Post content

Sentiment – Positive, Negative, Neutral

Platform – Social media platform

Likes & Retweets – Engagement metrics

Timestamp – Posting time

Country, Year, Month, Day, Hour

**Analysis & Visualizations**

Here are the key charts generated:

1. Top 10 Most Common Sentiments

2. Posts per Hour of the Day

3. Sentiment by Platform

4. Posts per Weekday

5. Posts per Platform

6. Yearly Sentiment Trend

7. Likes Distribution by Sentiment

8. Retweets Distribution by Sentiment

 **Key Insights**

Positive sentiment was the most frequent across platforms.

Posting activity peaked during evening hours (15–20h).

Twitter had the highest posting volume compared to other platforms.

Sentiment distribution varied by platform, with Instagram showing more positive posts.

Engagement (likes & retweets) was higher for positive posts compared to negative ones.

 **Conclusion**

This project highlights the importance of EDA in understanding social media sentiment trends.
It also demonstrates my ability to handle text-based datasets, clean and process data, and communicate findings with visualizations.

 Next Steps

Extend analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP) for deeper sentiment classification.

Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI / Tableau.
